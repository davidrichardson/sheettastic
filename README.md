Playing around with an API to load spreadsheets and map them to JSON docs

Intended flow:

- User uploads spreadsheet
- API stores it
- API maps columns to fields
- User retrieves mapping proposal
- User corrects mapping proposal
- User approves mapping
- API maps rows to documents based on mapping proposal
